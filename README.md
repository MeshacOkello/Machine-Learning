# Machine-Learning
## Overview
This repository contains implementations of fundamental machine learning models using Perceptrons in Java. It includes:

- **Perceptron:** A basic binary classifier using a linear decision boundary.
- **MultiPerceptron:** A multi-class classifier built with multiple Perceptron models.
- **ImageClassifier:** A perceptron-based model for classifying images based on pixel intensity.

Each module includes **training, prediction, and evaluation** functionalities.

##  Features
 Implements **binary classification** with the Perceptron algorithm.  
 Supports **multi-class classification** using a **one-vs-all** Perceptron approach.  
 Includes an **image classification model** that extracts pixel intensity as features.  
 Uses **depth-first search (DFS) and statistical modeling** for decision-making.  
 Provides **training and testing functionalities** with real-world data.
